## Core Features

### Auth

- Supabase login/signup
- Session persistence
- Magic link support
- Link on first login: map Supabase user to Shopify customer and persist identifiers

### Shopify

- Product listing
- Single product query
- customerAccessTokenCreate mutation
- Customer create/link flow for account mapping

### Cart

- Local cart state (sync to Shopify on checkout)

### Profile

- Fetch & update user profile from Supabase
- Store Shopify customer ID/token

### Checkout

- Redirect to Shopify web checkout via Storefront API

## Project Description

This project is a modern, mobile-first shopping app built with React Native (Expo), TypeScript, and a modular architecture. The app provides a seamless shopping experience, allowing users to browse products, manage their cart, mark favorites, search, and handle user authentication. It integrates with Shopify Storefront API for product data and Supabase for authentication and user data management.

## Project Specification

### 1. Core Features

- Product browsing and search (from Shopify)
- Product details and images
- Add to cart, view cart, and checkout flow
- User authentication (Supabase)
- Favorites/wishlist management
- User profile management
- Responsive, themed UI with reusable components

### 2. Screens & Navigation

#### Tab Navigation (in app/(tabs)/)

- **Home/Shop (index.tsx or shop.tsx)**: Displays featured and all products, categories, and promotions.
- **Search (search.tsx)**: Allows users to search products by keyword or filter by category.
- **Cart (cart.tsx)**: Shows items in the cart, allows quantity updates, and proceeds to checkout.
- **Favorites (favorites.tsx)**: Displays user's favorite products.
- **Profile (profile.tsx)**: User account info, order history, and settings.

#### Product Details

- **Product Detail (product/[id].tsx)**: Shows detailed product info, images, price, add-to-cart, and favorite options.

#### Other Screens

- **Not Found (+not-found.tsx)**: Custom 404 for invalid routes.

### 3. Components

Located in components/:

- **ProductCard**: Displays product image, title, price, and quick actions.
- **Button**: Reusable button component.
- **LoadingSpinner**: For loading states.
- **HomeHeader, CommonHeader**: App and section headers.
- **ui/**: Icon and tab bar background components.

### 4. State Management

Located in store/:

- **authStore.ts**: Handles user authentication state (login, logout, session).
- **productStore.ts**: Manages product list, cart, favorites, and search state.

### 5. Hooks

Located in hooks/:

### 6. Constants

Located in constants/:

- **Colors.ts**: Centralized color palette.

### 7. Assets

Located in assets/:

- **fonts/**: Custom fonts.
- **images/**: App icons, splash, and product images.

### 8. Integrations

#### Shopify Storefront API

- Fetch product lists, details, images, and categories.
- Use GraphQL queries in lib/api.ts.
- Map Shopify product data to app's Product type.

#### Supabase

- User authentication (sign up, login, session management).
- Store user-specific data (favorites, order history, etc.).
- Integration code in lib/supabase.ts and store/authStore.ts.

## üîê Auth & Identity Flow

- **Primary source of identity**: Supabase Auth
- **Link on First Login**:

  1. User signs up or logs in with Supabase (email/password or magic link).
  2. App checks Shopify for a customer with the same email.
     - If found: store the Shopify `customerId` and a `customerAccessToken` in Supabase `profiles`.
     - If not found: create a Shopify customer and store the new identifiers.
  3. All customer-specific Shopify operations (orders, profile) use the stored access token.
  4. Optional: allow in-app Shopify login using `customerAccessTokenCreate` and link to the same Supabase user.

- **Sync logic via Supabase Edge Functions** (optional for MVP): encapsulate linking, token refresh/rotation, and push-trigger logic securely.
  - Note: Storefront API cannot search customers by email. Implement email lookup via a Supabase Edge Function using the Shopify Admin API, then link and persist `shopify_customer_id` and a `customerAccessToken` in Supabase.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Backend/API Flow

No traditional Node.js backend needed. All business logic handled by:

- Supabase Edge Functions (secure server-side)
- Shopify Storefront GraphQL API

## üîî Push Notification Integration

### Purpose

Engage users via:

- Order updates
- Promotional alerts
- Welcome messages
- Cart reminders

### Notification Flow

1. **Register device token on login**:

   - Call `Notifications.getExpoPushTokenAsync()` after Supabase login
   - Store token in Supabase profiles table

2. **Store Push Token in Supabase**:
   Schema update:

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE profiles ADD COLUMN expo_push_token TEXT;
   ```

3. **Trigger Push Notifications**:
   - Use Supabase Edge Function to send a POST request to:
     `https://exp.host/--/api/v2/push/send`

### 9. Configuration

- **config.ts**: Stores API keys, endpoints, and environment variables for Shopify and Supabase.

### 10. Type Definitions

- **type.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for products, users, cart items, etc.

## Summary

This project is a scalable, maintainable shopping app with a clean architecture, leveraging Shopify for e-commerce data and Supabase for authentication and user data. The codebase is organized for easy extension, theming, and component reuse.
