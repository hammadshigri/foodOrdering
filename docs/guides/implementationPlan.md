# Implementation Plan - React Native Clothing App

## 🎯 Project Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for building a modern React Native clothing app with Shopify & Supabase integration, featuring a sophisticated black & white theme with modern UI components.

- [x] Persist `shopify_customer_id` and customer access token in Supabase profile
- [x] Use stored Shopify token for customer data requests

## 📚 Detailed Phase Documentation

### Phase 1: Project Setup

**File:** [phase1-project-setup.md](./phase1-project-setup.md)
**Timeline:** 1-2 days
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Phase 2: Authentication

**File:** [phase2-authentication.md](./phase2-authentication.md)
**Timeline:** 2-3 days
**Status:** 🔄 PENDING

Includes account linking on first login: after successful Supabase signup or login, attempt to locate a Shopify customer by email and store the `shopify_customer_id` and customer access token in the user's Supabase profile. If no customer exists, create one and persist identifiers.

### Phase 3: Shopify Integration

**File:** [phase3-shopify-integration.md](./phase3-shopify-integration.md)
**Timeline:** 3-4 days
**Status:** 🔄 PENDING

Implements Storefront API customer mutations/queries used by the linking flow (e.g., `customerCreate`, `customerAccessTokenCreate`) and ensures all customer-specific data fetches use the stored access token from Supabase.

### Phase 4: Core Features & Modern UI

**File:** [phase4-core-features.md](./phase4-core-features.md)
**Timeline:** 4-5 days
**Status:** 🔄 PENDING

### Phase 5: State Management

### 🔗 Link on First Login – High-Level Flow

1. User signs up or logs in via Supabase (email/password or magic link).
2. App checks Shopify for an existing customer using the email.
   - If found: store Shopify `customerId` and a `customerAccessToken` in Supabase `profiles`.
   - If not found: create the customer via Storefront API and store the new identifiers.
3. All customer-specific Shopify operations (orders, profile) use the stored access token.
4. Optional: provide "Sign in with Shopify" in-app using `customerAccessTokenCreate` and link to the same Supabase user.

## 🔧 Development Tips

- Use the modern theme system for consistent styling
- Implement glassmorphism effects for premium feel
- Add smooth animations for better user experience
- Test modern UI on real devices frequently
- Optimize performance for modern interactions
